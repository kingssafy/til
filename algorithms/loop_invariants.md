# Loop Invariants
 We use loop invariants to help us understand why an algorithm is correct.
 We must show three things about a loop invariant.
---
1. Initialization: It is true prior to the first iteration of the loop
2. Maintenance: If it is true before an iteration of the loop, it reamins true before the next iteration.
3. Termination: When the loop terminates, the invariant gives us a useful property that helps show that the algorithm is correct.
